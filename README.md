Surreal HTMX Go
===============

Example HTMX web apps using Go and Surreal. I wanted to get Locality of
Behaviour but also wanted to go back to relearning Javascript instead of 
learning Hyperscript. The excellent library [Surreal](https://github.com/gnat/surreal)
allows this to be done easily.

One day I hope to make all of the [example HTMX apps](https://htmx.org/examples/)
but for now I've picked the first one that had extensive Hypescript which was 
edit-row
